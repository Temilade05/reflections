What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	When a git repository is initialised, a file ".git" is created in the root of the 
	folder that is to be tracked. This file is responsible for tracking all the 
	actions that would be performed on the project. If you do not initialize
	it, you wont be able to add commits to git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	In the staging area, you can't actually change files that are present. The working
	directory actually contains all the files that you are working on in real time.
	The repository contains commits that have already been "saved". This commits can be
	checked out depending on what the programmer needs to achieve at a point in time.

change?
